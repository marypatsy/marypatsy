### From 1978 to 1995, the man known as the Unabomber was pursued by the FBI until they finally got lucky. Today, we look back at the writings that were used to identify him and see how we could use current technology and statistical techniques to try and come up with the evidence ourselves. We break down what statistics methods and basic coding and linguistic techniques we used, then show what results we came up with in our attempt to Catch the Unabomber with Statistics.
